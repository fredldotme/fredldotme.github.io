## Ideas for a new Lomiri vision

01:48: The ideas I am going to lay down publicly and make open for discussions
allow for a refresh in where to take Lomiri, ex Unity8, and have an overview of
where to take the Desktop as an attempt to bring access to more Lomiri features
to a wide audience, but have the experience rely less on the Lomiri community.

Instead provide a useful shell and a shell environment implementation of certain
technologies, as used to from the code base, but also make it fit with more sophisticated
Shell details and designs as provided by the UBports community.

I'm open for discussions on how to make the UI of Lomiri (the shell ex-Unity8)
have a cleaner and more streamlined UX across all kinds of form factors: the phone, the tablet,
the desktop experience on stationary as well as as on laptops and other keyboard computing devices.
